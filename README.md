README : AnyVision Home Assignment

This zipfile contains all the files needed to run this application.
*npm run build* has already been run.

All thats needed in order to run the app is:

- npm install
- npm start

In order to implement mongoDB in the app I used a free mongo-db hosting service called : Mlab (https://mlab.com)

For convenience I have left the url link to that database but it can be swapped out with your own mongodb link.
You will find this in the server.js file at line 13
****
Once the server is running, navigate to = http://localhost:8080/
